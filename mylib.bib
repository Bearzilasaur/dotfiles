  title = {The Daily-Scale Entrance Dynamics of Intermittently Open/Closed Estuaries},
  volume = {43},
  abstract = {Intermittently open/closed estuaries (IOCE) are a dynamic form of estuary characterised by periodic entrance closure to the ocean. Entrance closure is a function of the relative balance between on and offshore sediment transport with closures occurring during periods of low fluvial discharge whereby the estuary ebb-tidal prism is reduced. Although the broad scale processes of entrance closure are becoming better understood, there remains limited knowledge on channel morphodynamics during an individual closure event. In this study, the entrance dynamics of three IOCE on the coast of Victoria, Australia, were monitored over a daily timescale following both artificial and natural openings. The influence of changing marine and fluvial conditions on the relative sedimentation rate within the entrance channel was examined. IOCE in Victoria showed two distinct modes of entrance closure: (a) lateral accretion, whereby the estuary gradually closes by longshore drift-driven spit growth during low river flows; and (b) vertical accretion, where the channel rapidly aggrades under high ({$>$} 2 m), near-normal waves. During storms, when fluvial discharge and wave heights simultaneously increase, large swells will not always close the mouth due to an increase in the ebb-tidal prism. The estuary water depth and the maximum channel dimensions following opening were not proportional to the opening duration, with this being a function of the wave and fluvial conditions occurring following lagoon drainage. Based on the findings of this work, implementing a successful artificial entrance opening is dependent on reduced onshore sedimentation rates which occur when wave energy is low ({$<$} 2 m Hs) relative to river flow.

  volume = {292},
  abstract = {Intermittently Closed/Open Lakes and Lagoons (ICOLLs) are a particularly dynamic form of estuary characterised by periodic entrance closure to the ocean. Closure occurs when a subaerial sand berm stabilises across the entrance channel during times of low fluvial discharge. ICOLLs are of global importance as they provide valuable ecological habitats for many species and are associated with a wide range of management issues due to their cycle of entrance closure and opening. ICOLLs are found to be more widespread globally than previously described with 1477 of these estuaries being identified in this study. This constitutes an estimated 3\% of the world's estuaries and 15\% of all estuaries along microtidal coastlines. ICOLLs are concentrated along microtidal to low mesotidal coastlines in the mid-latitudes and predominantly on coasts with temperate climates. This distribution is related to greater wave heights as driven by high intensity winds and a longer fetch distance. The highest proportion of ICOLLs are present in Australia (21\% all global ICOLLs), South Africa (16\%) and Mexico (16\%). In Australia, a comparison with fluvial input found that it is less important than marine processes in determining ICOLL formation and that ICOLLs are associated with a relative tidal range of \&lt; 3.22. Additionally the majority of ICOLLS are small systems with catchments \&lt; 2000 km2 and tidal prisms \&lt; 30 \texttimes{} 106 m3, forming at the mouths of rivers with generally low mean annual and specific discharges. \textcopyright{} 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

  title = {A Geomorphic Classification of Intermittently Open/Closed Estuaries ({{IOCE}}) Derived from Estuaries in {{Victoria}}, {{Australia}}},
  volume = {41},
  abstract = {A large proportion of estuaries along microtidal wave-dominated coastlines worldwide have entrances that intermittently close to the ocean when tidal currents and fluvial discharge are insufficient to erode sediment delivered onshore by waves. In this study, these systems are termed ``intermittently open/closed estuaries'' (IOCE) in order to include all estuaries which intermittently close to the ocean. IOCE do not fit neatly into existing generalized estuary classification models and have been traditionally recognized as a single estuary type that constitute a rare subset of wave-dominated estuaries. In this study, 111 estuaries in Victoria, Australia, are used to develop a classification model that delineates between different IOCE types. This was undertaken using historic aerial imagery and quantification of the estuary channel width, catchment area, lagoon dimensions and tidal prism derived from remotely sensed data. Field surveying of entrance morphology was undertaken for a subsample of 35 IOCE characteristic of each section of the coast and which had detailed entrance condition records. Using this subset, IOCE were classified into three distinct types using multiple methods of statistical delineation (non-metric multidimensional scaling, hierarchical cluster analysis and distribution analysis). These three types are: (1) Type A, the largest IOCE which both close and open infrequently but for the longest durations; (2) Type B, medium sized IOCE which open and close several times per year for weekly to monthly durations; and (3) Type C (tidal creeks), the smallest IOCE located specifically in high rainfall, mountainous catchments and which exist in a predominantly open state. The three types of IOCE showed an order of magnitude difference in entrance closure duration as controlled by variations in the catchment area, tidal prism volume, dimensions of the estuarine lagoon and the entrance channel at the mouth. The classification is also applicable to wave-dominated coastlines internationally where IOCE are present. \textcopyright{} 2017, \textcopyright{} The Author(s) 2017.},

  abstract = {In the equatorial Atlantic the Cear{\'a} and Sierra Leone rises lie on opposing sides of the mid-ocean ridge and are equidistant from its axis. The northern and southern boundaries respectively, of the two rises are formed by the same fracture zones. The area of shallowest acoustic basement under the Cear{\'a} Rise coincides with the presence of a 1\textendash{}2 km thick seismic layer (velocity: 3.5 km/sec) lying over the oceanic layer 2. This 3.5 km/sec layer is interpreted as a sequence of volcanics which began erupting about 80 m.y. ago when the sites of the two rises lay at the ridge axis. As the ``abnormal'' volcanic activity ceased, the breakup of this volcanic pile into two pieces has formed the Cear{\'a} and Sierra Leone rises. In the South Atlantic, the northern and southern boundaries of the Rio Grande Rise are also formed by fracture zones and an approximately 1 km thick layer with a velocity of 3.5 km/sec exists also under this rise. The same fracture zones appear to bound the Walvis Ridge. Drilling data suggests that both the Rio Grande Rise and Walvis Ridge have subsided continuously since their creation. The igneous rocks recovered from both rises consist of alkalic basaltic suites typical of oceanic volcanic islands. The existing data favor a model in which ``excessive'' volcanism along the same segment of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge created both the South Atlantic aseismic rises between 100 and 80 m.y. ago. In both the examples, the northern and southern boundaries of the rises are formed by the same fracture zones which originally bounded the abnormally active segment of the ridge axis.},

The pigeonite cores are characterized by high magnesium contents [FeFe + Mg = 0.19 on the average]; their crystallization temperatures based on the three-pyroxene geothermometer are thus estimated to be higher than those of the well-studied tholeiitic pyroxene assemblages (Hakone, Weiselberg, Mull, Skaergaard, and Bushveld). It is suggested from textural and chemical relationships that pyroxene crystallization started first with precipitation of pigeonite followed by simultaneous precipitation of pigeonite and augite and finally by crystallization of augite alone in the groundmass.},

Strontium isotope ratios, close to the Cretaceous\textemdash{}Cenozoic ocean water values, are well in agreement with such a kind of sea water/ophicalcites interaction, even if the carbonate cement formed earlier during the Jurassic period.},

The orientation of the spurs was studied as a function of the direction of the swell crests which are either parallel or oblique to the alignment of the reef front of the ``Grand R{\'e}cif'' which extends over 18 km. When the swell is oblique, the spurs are not, as is generally held, perpendicular to the crests of the swell. The orientation of the spurs is a resultant direction between the direction of the swell orthogonals and the direction of the slope of the outer reef flat. From aerial photographs one can determine the directions of the spurs and of the slope of the outer reef flat. It is easy to obtain the direction of the crests of the swell and then to construct the wave diagram. The morphological aspects and the distribution of the deposits on the inner flat of the coral reef tract depend on the orientation of the swell.

Data from a twenty day deployment of the GEOPROBE system in Norton Sound, Alaska, during the period September 24 \textendash{} October 14, 1976 show that threshold conditions for sediment movement are commonly exceeded, even in calm weather periods, due to the additive effects of tidal currents, mean circulation, and surface waves.},

The elements determined both in seawater and shell carbonate are: Ca, Mg, Mn, Fe, Ni, Co, Cu, Zn, Sr and Pb. Both species studied discriminate against all the minor and trace elements determined; the degree of such discrimination, for some elements, is inversely related to salinity. The mineralogical composition of the shells (Monodonta has a mixed mineralogy while Cerastoderma is entirely aragonitic) appears to be controlled neither by temperature nor by salinity. In Monodonta shells direct correlations have been found between the following parameters: calcite-Sr (in younger shells only), calcite-Fe, calcite-Pb (in older shells only), calcite-Zn, salinity-Mg and salinity-Pb, whereas inverse correlations were observed between calcite and Sr (in older shells only) and calcite and Pb (in younger shells only). In Cerastoderma shells a direct correlation was found between salinity and Fe and Mg. The thickness of the shells appears, in both species, to be an inverse linear function of salinity.},

  volume = {30},
  issn = {0025-3227},
  abstract = {The Miami Terrace is a drowned early to middle Tertiary carbonate platform, the outer margin of which has been deeply incised by submarine erosion subsequent to deposition of the limestone terrace. This interpretation is based on the study of high-resolution seismic reflection profiles, rock dredge samples, observations from deep-diving submersibles, and correlation with drill-hole data. The karstic upper terrace (200\textendash{}375 m) yields limestones and dolostones of early middle Miocene age that have shallow-shelf affinities. Truncated beds of an eastward-dipping deeper-water slope facies are exposed on the upper surface of the erosional lower terrace at 600\textendash{}700 m. The upper and lower terraces are separated by a discontinuous ridge, probably a drowned Miocene, or post-Miocene bank margin complex. Both terraces and the ridge are capped by dense conglomeratic phosphorites and phosphatic limestones. Phosphorite nodules are more common on the lower terrace whereas the upper terrace yields large phosphorite slabs as well as shark's teeth and bones of marine mammals. Petrographic study of dredged and submersible-sampled rocks shows that two or more episodes of phosphatization took place intermittent with erosion, grain rounding, reworking and redeposition. Early stages of phosphatization appear to be selective, replacing the more unstable carbonate minerals first, while later stages are nonselective. The origin of most of the phosphorites is the diagenetic replacement of calcium carbonate by francolite. The karst surface of the upper terrace appears to have been produced by subaerial exposure in the middle to late Miocene as evidenced by shallow-water components in the rocks of the upper terrace plus considerations of local subsidence and eustatic sea-level curves. The erosional lower terrace, 200\textendash{}300 m deeper than the upper terrace, would have been too deep to have been produced by subaerial or wave erosion. An erosional hiatus of middle Miocene age in JOIDES drill holes on the Blake Plateau indicates that bottom-current velocities in this area increased over this interval. The formation of the lower erosional terrace is related to increased flow of the Gulf Stream system (Florida Current) and bioerosion concurrent with the tectonic uplift and oceanographic closure of the western Caribbean in mid-Miocene time. The bathymetry, petrology, structure and paleontology of the Miami Terrace, along with correlative data from adjacent areas, argue that a more active Gulf Stream system began as early as the middle Miocene (10.5\textendash{}16 m.y.B.P.) rather than the early to middle Pliocene (3.5\textendash{}4.0 m.y.B.P.) as previously suggested.},

  abstract = {Offshore exploration during the 1960's for gold off southern New South Wales and for tin in Tasmanian waters did not result in the discovery of economic deposits. Although very rich gold-bearing beach placers were worked in the past, individual deposits were small and rested on bed rock; the chances of locating and exploiting similar deposits offshore appear to be remote. In the case of tin, sub-economic resources were outlined in submerged river channels at a number of places off northeastern Tasmania. Such channels can be outlined by seismic methods, but to locate workable tin deposits in the buried alluvium by drilling alone is likely to be impracticable and successful exploration may depend on the development of other geophysical prospecting techniques. Large resources of rutile- and zircon-bearing heavy-mineral sands have been indicated off the east Australian coast by mining company work, but no economic deposits have been found to date. Studies of the morphology of the eastern shelf by the Bureau of Mineral Resources have revealed linear features believed to be related to shore lines developed during Quaternary low sea-level still stands. The most persistent of these off northern N.S.W. are about 105 m, 85 m, and between 35 and 45 m below present sea level. A widespread change of slope at a depth of 20\textendash{}30 m marks the base of the main body of the present-day paralic-zone wedge of sediment, but seismic profiles indicate that a veneer of recent sediment commonly extends seawards into water depths of about 100 m. Much of the outer shelf is floored by relict sediments and extensive areas of bed rock crop out on the middle shelf. Virtually all sub-surface data from company drilling for heavy-mineral sands relates to the present-day paralic-zone wedge of sediments; this wedge includes undisturbed sedimentary sequences deposited during pre-Holocene high sea-level periods. No large economic-grade deposits have been outlined by this work offshore, and there is reason to believe that the bulk of the heavy-mineral deposits formed during Holocene and previous high sea-level stands are located above present sea level. In addition, the best-developed submerged strand lines are in deep water probably inaccessible to mining. Nevertheless, the possibility that substantial deposits occur offshore in moderate water depths exists. Outcrops of bed rock are extensive in the mid-shelf zone in the southern part of the area, but north of 29\textdegree{} S they are much less common. Significant areas with sediment thicknesses greater than 20 m in water depths of less than 60 m occur to the east of Newcastle, to the southeast of Smoky Cape, and to the north of Yamba. Two sediment sequences, an upper and a lower, are recognizable. Highest heavy-mineral values in surface sediments occur offshore from the Permo-Triassic basins. Subsurface enrichment may occur at the junction of the upper and lower sequences, or where the upper sequence overlies basement. The abundance of heavy minerals is a function of the total sediment throughput, and the intensity and direction of shore-line sorting, so that the highest potential for accumulation occurs in the northern part of the area. The most likely prospective areas occur mainly near Cape Byron and near Sugarloaf Point. These areas have been defined on the basis of the thickness of sediments, the depth to the base of the upper sequence, the distribution of ancient strand lines, and the abundance of heavy minerals in the surface sediments.},

  volume = {30},
  issn = {0025-3227},
  abstract = {In the equatorial Atlantic the Cear{\'a} and Sierra Leone rises lie on opposing sides of the mid-ocean ridge and are equidistant from its axis. The northern and southern boundaries respectively, of the two rises are formed by the same fracture zones. The area of shallowest acoustic basement under the Cear{\'a} Rise coincides with the presence of a 1\textendash{}2 km thick seismic layer (velocity: 3.5 km/sec) lying over the oceanic layer 2. This 3.5 km/sec layer is interpreted as a sequence of volcanics which began erupting about 80 m.y. ago when the sites of the two rises lay at the ridge axis. As the ``abnormal'' volcanic activity ceased, the breakup of this volcanic pile into two pieces has formed the Cear{\'a} and Sierra Leone rises. In the South Atlantic, the northern and southern boundaries of the Rio Grande Rise are also formed by fracture zones and an approximately 1 km thick layer with a velocity of 3.5 km/sec exists also under this rise. The same fracture zones appear to bound the Walvis Ridge. Drilling data suggests that both the Rio Grande Rise and Walvis Ridge have subsided continuously since their creation. The igneous rocks recovered from both rises consist of alkalic basaltic suites typical of oceanic volcanic islands. The existing data favor a model in which ``excessive'' volcanism along the same segment of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge created both the South Atlantic aseismic rises between 100 and 80 m.y. ago. In both the examples, the northern and southern boundaries of the rises are formed by the same fracture zones which originally bounded the abnormally active segment of the ridge axis.},

The pigeonite cores are characterized by high magnesium contents [FeFe + Mg = 0.19 on the average]; their crystallization temperatures based on the three-pyroxene geothermometer are thus estimated to be higher than those of the well-studied tholeiitic pyroxene assemblages (Hakone, Weiselberg, Mull, Skaergaard, and Bushveld). It is suggested from textural and chemical relationships that pyroxene crystallization started first with precipitation of pigeonite followed by simultaneous precipitation of pigeonite and augite and finally by crystallization of augite alone in the groundmass.},

The 18O/16O values of most of the carbonates studied, however, indicate that the rocks have interacted with hydrothermal fluids, dominantly represented by sea water. In particular, the rocks from the northern section of the Apennines apparently reequilibrated their {$\delta$} 18O content at higher temperature than those from the central zone. Strontium isotope ratios, close to the Cretaceous\textemdash{}Cenozoic ocean water values, are well in agreement with such a kind of sea water/ophicalcites interaction, even if the carbonate cement formed earlier during the Jurassic period.},

All types of coral reef tracts are present: outer or barrier reefs, lagoon reefs and coral banks. The orientation of the spurs was studied as a function of the direction of the swell crests which are either parallel or oblique to the alignment of the reef front of the ``Grand R{\'e}cif'' which extends over 18 km. When the swell is oblique, the spurs are not, as is generally held, perpendicular to the crests of the swell. The orientation of the spurs is a resultant direction between the direction of the swell orthogonals and the direction of the slope of the outer reef flat. From aerial photographs one can determine the directions of the spurs and of the slope of the outer reef flat. It is easy to obtain the direction of the crests of the swell and then to construct the wave diagram. The morphological aspects and the distribution of the deposits on the inner flat of the coral reef tract depend on the orientation of the swell.

Simultaneous in situ digital recording of pressure, temperature, light scattering, and light transmission, in combination with current velocity profiles measured with a near-bottom vertical array of electromagnetic current meters, is used to correlate bottom shear generated by a variety of oceanic processes (waves, tides, mean flow, etc.) with incipient movement and resuspension of bottom sediment. A bottom camera system that is activated when current speeds exceed preset threshold values provides a unique method to identify initial sediment motion and bed form development. Data from a twenty day deployment of the GEOPROBE system in Norton Sound, Alaska, during the period September 24 \textendash{} October 14, 1976 show that threshold conditions for sediment movement are commonly exceeded, even in calm weather periods, due to the additive effects of tidal currents, mean circulation, and surface waves.},

The elements determined both in seawater and shell carbonate are: Ca, Mg, Mn, Fe, Ni, Co, Cu, Zn, Sr and Pb. Both species studied discriminate against all the minor and trace elements determined; the degree of such discrimination, for some elements, is inversely related to salinity. The mineralogical composition of the shells (Monodonta has a mixed mineralogy while Cerastoderma is entirely aragonitic) appears to be controlled neither by temperature nor by salinity. In Monodonta shells direct correlations have been found between the following parameters: calcite-Sr (in younger shells only), calcite-Fe, calcite-Pb (in older shells only), calcite-Zn, salinity-Mg and salinity-Pb, whereas inverse correlations were observed between calcite and Sr (in older shells only) and calcite and Pb (in younger shells only). In Cerastoderma shells a direct correlation was found between salinity and Fe and Mg. The thickness of the shells appears, in both species, to be an inverse linear function of salinity.},

  title = {Geology of the {{Miami Terrace}} and Its Paleo-Oceanographic Implications},
  volume = {30},
  issn = {0025-3227},
  abstract = {The Miami Terrace is a drowned early to middle Tertiary carbonate platform, the outer margin of which has been deeply incised by submarine erosion subsequent to deposition of the limestone terrace. This interpretation is based on the study of high-resolution seismic reflection profiles, rock dredge samples, observations from deep-diving submersibles, and correlation with drill-hole data. The karstic upper terrace (200\textendash{}375 m) yields limestones and dolostones of early middle Miocene age that have shallow-shelf affinities. Truncated beds of an eastward-dipping deeper-water slope facies are exposed on the upper surface of the erosional lower terrace at 600\textendash{}700 m. The upper and lower terraces are separated by a discontinuous ridge, probably a drowned Miocene, or post-Miocene bank margin complex. Both terraces and the ridge are capped by dense conglomeratic phosphorites and phosphatic limestones. Phosphorite nodules are more common on the lower terrace whereas the upper terrace yields large phosphorite slabs as well as shark's teeth and bones of marine mammals. Petrographic study of dredged and submersible-sampled rocks shows that two or more episodes of phosphatization took place intermittent with erosion, grain rounding, reworking and redeposition. Early stages of phosphatization appear to be selective, replacing the more unstable carbonate minerals first, while later stages are nonselective. The origin of most of the phosphorites is the diagenetic replacement of calcium carbonate by francolite. The karst surface of the upper terrace appears to have been produced by subaerial exposure in the middle to late Miocene as evidenced by shallow-water components in the rocks of the upper terrace plus considerations of local subsidence and eustatic sea-level curves. The erosional lower terrace, 200\textendash{}300 m deeper than the upper terrace, would have been too deep to have been produced by subaerial or wave erosion. An erosional hiatus of middle Miocene age in JOIDES drill holes on the Blake Plateau indicates that bottom-current velocities in this area increased over this interval. The formation of the lower erosional terrace is related to increased flow of the Gulf Stream system (Florida Current) and bioerosion concurrent with the tectonic uplift and oceanographic closure of the western Caribbean in mid-Miocene time. The bathymetry, petrology, structure and paleontology of the Miami Terrace, along with correlative data from adjacent areas, argue that a more active Gulf Stream system began as early as the middle Miocene (10.5\textendash{}16 m.y.B.P.) rather than the early to middle Pliocene (3.5\textendash{}4.0 m.y.B.P.) as previously suggested.},

No large economic-grade deposits have been outlined by this work offshore, and there is reason to believe that the bulk of the heavy-mineral deposits formed during Holocene and previous high sea-level stands are located above present sea level. In addition, the best-developed submerged strand lines are in deep water probably inaccessible to mining. Nevertheless, the possibility that substantial deposits occur offshore in moderate water depths exists. Outcrops of bed rock are extensive in the mid-shelf zone in the southern part of the area, but north of 29\textdegree{} S they are much less common. Significant areas with sediment thicknesses greater than 20 m in water depths of less than 60 m occur to the east of Newcastle, to the southeast of Smoky Cape, and to the north of Yamba. Two sediment sequences, an upper and a lower, are recognizable. Highest heavy-mineral values in surface sediments occur offshore from the Permo-Triassic basins. Subsurface enrichment may occur at the junction of the upper and lower sequences, or where the upper sequence overlies basement. The abundance of heavy minerals is a function of the total sediment throughput, and the intensity and direction of shore-line sorting, so that the highest potential for accumulation occurs in the northern part of the area. The most likely prospective areas occur mainly near Cape Byron and near Sugarloaf Point. These areas have been defined on the basis of the thickness of sediments, the depth to the base of the upper sequence, the distribution of ancient strand lines, and the abundance of heavy minerals in the surface sediments.},

  volume = {30},
  issn = {0025-3227},
  abstract = {In the equatorial Atlantic the Cear{\'a} and Sierra Leone rises lie on opposing sides of the mid-ocean ridge and are equidistant from its axis. The northern and southern boundaries respectively, of the two rises are formed by the same fracture zones. The area of shallowest acoustic basement under the Cear{\'a} Rise coincides with the presence of a 1\textendash{}2 km thick seismic layer (velocity: 3.5 km/sec) lying over the oceanic layer 2. This 3.5 km/sec layer is interpreted as a sequence of volcanics which began erupting about 80 m.y. ago when the sites of the two rises lay at the ridge axis. As the ``abnormal'' volcanic activity ceased, the breakup of this volcanic pile into two pieces has formed the Cear{\'a} and Sierra Leone rises. In the South Atlantic, the northern and southern boundaries of the Rio Grande Rise are also formed by fracture zones and an approximately 1 km thick layer with a velocity of 3.5 km/sec exists also under this rise. The same fracture zones appear to bound the Walvis Ridge. Drilling data suggests that both the Rio Grande Rise and Walvis Ridge have subsided continuously since their creation. The igneous rocks recovered from both rises consist of alkalic basaltic suites typical of oceanic volcanic islands. The existing data favor a model in which ``excessive'' volcanism along the same segment of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge created both the South Atlantic aseismic rises between 100 and 80 m.y. ago. In both the examples, the northern and southern boundaries of the rises are formed by the same fracture zones which originally bounded the abnormally active segment of the ridge axis.},

The pigeonite cores are characterized by high magnesium contents [FeFe + Mg = 0.19 on the average]; their crystallization temperatures based on the three-pyroxene geothermometer are thus estimated to be higher than those of the well-studied tholeiitic pyroxene assemblages (Hakone, Weiselberg, Mull, Skaergaard, and Bushveld). It is suggested from textural and chemical relationships that pyroxene crystallization started first with precipitation of pigeonite followed by simultaneous precipitation of pigeonite and augite and finally by crystallization of augite alone in the groundmass.},

The 18O/16O values of most of the carbonates studied, however, indicate that the rocks have interacted with hydrothermal fluids, dominantly represented by sea water. In particular, the rocks from the northern section of the Apennines apparently reequilibrated their {$\delta$} 18O content at higher temperature than those from the central zone. Strontium isotope ratios, close to the Cretaceous\textemdash{}Cenozoic ocean water values, are well in agreement with such a kind of sea water/ophicalcites interaction, even if the carbonate cement formed earlier during the Jurassic period.},

All types of coral reef tracts are present: outer or barrier reefs, lagoon reefs and coral banks. The orientation of the spurs was studied as a function of the direction of the swell crests which are either parallel or oblique to the alignment of the reef front of the ``Grand R{\'e}cif'' which extends over 18 km. When the swell is oblique, the spurs are not, as is generally held, perpendicular to the crests of the swell. The orientation of the spurs is a resultant direction between the direction of the swell orthogonals and the direction of the slope of the outer reef flat. From aerial photographs one can determine the directions of the spurs and of the slope of the outer reef flat. It is easy to obtain the direction of the crests of the swell and then to construct the wave diagram. The morphological aspects and the distribution of the deposits on the inner flat of the coral reef tract depend on the orientation of the swell.

Simultaneous in situ digital recording of pressure, temperature, light scattering, and light transmission, in combination with current velocity profiles measured with a near-bottom vertical array of electromagnetic current meters, is used to correlate bottom shear generated by a variety of oceanic processes (waves, tides, mean flow, etc.) with incipient movement and resuspension of bottom sediment. A bottom camera system that is activated when current speeds exceed preset threshold values provides a unique method to identify initial sediment motion and bed form development. Data from a twenty day deployment of the GEOPROBE system in Norton Sound, Alaska, during the period September 24 \textendash{} October 14, 1976 show that threshold conditions for sediment movement are commonly exceeded, even in calm weather periods, due to the additive effects of tidal currents, mean circulation, and surface waves.},

The elements determined both in seawater and shell carbonate are: Ca, Mg, Mn, Fe, Ni, Co, Cu, Zn, Sr and Pb. Both species studied discriminate against all the minor and trace elements determined; the degree of such discrimination, for some elements, is inversely related to salinity. The mineralogical composition of the shells (Monodonta has a mixed mineralogy while Cerastoderma is entirely aragonitic) appears to be controlled neither by temperature nor by salinity. In Monodonta shells direct correlations have been found between the following parameters: calcite-Sr (in younger shells only), calcite-Fe, calcite-Pb (in older shells only), calcite-Zn, salinity-Mg and salinity-Pb, whereas inverse correlations were observed between calcite and Sr (in older shells only) and calcite and Pb (in younger shells only). In Cerastoderma shells a direct correlation was found between salinity and Fe and Mg. The thickness of the shells appears, in both species, to be an inverse linear function of salinity.},

  title = {Geology of the {{Miami Terrace}} and Its Paleo-Oceanographic Implications},
  volume = {30},
  issn = {0025-3227},
  abstract = {The Miami Terrace is a drowned early to middle Tertiary carbonate platform, the outer margin of which has been deeply incised by submarine erosion subsequent to deposition of the limestone terrace. This interpretation is based on the study of high-resolution seismic reflection profiles, rock dredge samples, observations from deep-diving submersibles, and correlation with drill-hole data. The karstic upper terrace (200\textendash{}375 m) yields limestones and dolostones of early middle Miocene age that have shallow-shelf affinities. Truncated beds of an eastward-dipping deeper-water slope facies are exposed on the upper surface of the erosional lower terrace at 600\textendash{}700 m. The upper and lower terraces are separated by a discontinuous ridge, probably a drowned Miocene, or post-Miocene bank margin complex. Both terraces and the ridge are capped by dense conglomeratic phosphorites and phosphatic limestones. Phosphorite nodules are more common on the lower terrace whereas the upper terrace yields large phosphorite slabs as well as shark's teeth and bones of marine mammals. Petrographic study of dredged and submersible-sampled rocks shows that two or more episodes of phosphatization took place intermittent with erosion, grain rounding, reworking and redeposition. Early stages of phosphatization appear to be selective, replacing the more unstable carbonate minerals first, while later stages are nonselective. The origin of most of the phosphorites is the diagenetic replacement of calcium carbonate by francolite. The karst surface of the upper terrace appears to have been produced by subaerial exposure in the middle to late Miocene as evidenced by shallow-water components in the rocks of the upper terrace plus considerations of local subsidence and eustatic sea-level curves. The erosional lower terrace, 200\textendash{}300 m deeper than the upper terrace, would have been too deep to have been produced by subaerial or wave erosion. An erosional hiatus of middle Miocene age in JOIDES drill holes on the Blake Plateau indicates that bottom-current velocities in this area increased over this interval. The formation of the lower erosional terrace is related to increased flow of the Gulf Stream system (Florida Current) and bioerosion concurrent with the tectonic uplift and oceanographic closure of the western Caribbean in mid-Miocene time. The bathymetry, petrology, structure and paleontology of the Miami Terrace, along with correlative data from adjacent areas, argue that a more active Gulf Stream system began as early as the middle Miocene (10.5\textendash{}16 m.y.B.P.) rather than the early to middle Pliocene (3.5\textendash{}4.0 m.y.B.P.) as previously suggested.},

  volume = {30},
  issn = {0025-3227},
  abstract = {Offshore exploration during the 1960's for gold off southern New South Wales and for tin in Tasmanian waters did not result in the discovery of economic deposits. Although very rich gold-bearing beach placers were worked in the past, individual deposits were small and rested on bed rock; the chances of locating and exploiting similar deposits offshore appear to be remote. In the case of tin, sub-economic resources were outlined in submerged river channels at a number of places off northeastern Tasmania. Such channels can be outlined by seismic methods, but to locate workable tin deposits in the buried alluvium by drilling alone is likely to be impracticable and successful exploration may depend on the development of other geophysical prospecting techniques. Large resources of rutile- and zircon-bearing heavy-mineral sands have been indicated off the east Australian coast by mining company work, but no economic deposits have been found to date. Studies of the morphology of the eastern shelf by the Bureau of Mineral Resources have revealed linear features believed to be related to shore lines developed during Quaternary low sea-level still stands. The most persistent of these off northern N.S.W. are about 105 m, 85 m, and between 35 and 45 m below present sea level. A widespread change of slope at a depth of 20\textendash{}30 m marks the base of the main body of the present-day paralic-zone wedge of sediment, but seismic profiles indicate that a veneer of recent sediment commonly extends seawards into water depths of about 100 m. Much of the outer shelf is floored by relict sediments and extensive areas of bed rock crop out on the middle shelf. Virtually all sub-surface data from company drilling for heavy-mineral sands relates to the present-day paralic-zone wedge of sediments; this wedge includes undisturbed sedimentary sequences deposited during pre-Holocene high sea-level periods. No large economic-grade deposits have been outlined by this work offshore, and there is reason to believe that the bulk of the heavy-mineral deposits formed during Holocene and previous high sea-level stands are located above present sea level. In addition, the best-developed submerged strand lines are in deep water probably inaccessible to mining. Nevertheless, the possibility that substantial deposits occur offshore in moderate water depths exists. Outcrops of bed rock are extensive in the mid-shelf zone in the southern part of the area, but north of 29\textdegree{} S they are much less common. Significant areas with sediment thicknesses greater than 20 m in water depths of less than 60 m occur to the east of Newcastle, to the southeast of Smoky Cape, and to the north of Yamba. Two sediment sequences, an upper and a lower, are recognizable. Highest heavy-mineral values in surface sediments occur offshore from the Permo-Triassic basins. Subsurface enrichment may occur at the junction of the upper and lower sequences, or where the upper sequence overlies basement. The abundance of heavy minerals is a function of the total sediment throughput, and the intensity and direction of shore-line sorting, so that the highest potential for accumulation occurs in the northern part of the area. The most likely prospective areas occur mainly near Cape Byron and near Sugarloaf Point. These areas have been defined on the basis of the thickness of sediments, the depth to the base of the upper sequence, the distribution of ancient strand lines, and the abundance of heavy minerals in the surface sediments.},

  volume = {30},
  issn = {0025-3227},
  abstract = {In the equatorial Atlantic the Cear{\'a} and Sierra Leone rises lie on opposing sides of the mid-ocean ridge and are equidistant from its axis. The northern and southern boundaries respectively, of the two rises are formed by the same fracture zones. The area of shallowest acoustic basement under the Cear{\'a} Rise coincides with the presence of a 1\textendash{}2 km thick seismic layer (velocity: 3.5 km/sec) lying over the oceanic layer 2. This 3.5 km/sec layer is interpreted as a sequence of volcanics which began erupting about 80 m.y. ago when the sites of the two rises lay at the ridge axis. As the ``abnormal'' volcanic activity ceased, the breakup of this volcanic pile into two pieces has formed the Cear{\'a} and Sierra Leone rises. In the South Atlantic, the northern and southern boundaries of the Rio Grande Rise are also formed by fracture zones and an approximately 1 km thick layer with a velocity of 3.5 km/sec exists also under this rise. The same fracture zones appear to bound the Walvis Ridge. Drilling data suggests that both the Rio Grande Rise and Walvis Ridge have subsided continuously since their creation. The igneous rocks recovered from both rises consist of alkalic basaltic suites typical of oceanic volcanic islands. The existing data favor a model in which ``excessive'' volcanism along the same segment of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge created both the South Atlantic aseismic rises between 100 and 80 m.y. ago. In both the examples, the northern and southern boundaries of the rises are formed by the same fracture zones which originally bounded the abnormally active segment of the ridge axis.},

The pigeonite cores are characterized by high magnesium contents [FeFe + Mg = 0.19 on the average]; their crystallization temperatures based on the three-pyroxene geothermometer are thus estimated to be higher than those of the well-studied tholeiitic pyroxene assemblages (Hakone, Weiselberg, Mull, Skaergaard, and Bushveld). It is suggested from textural and chemical relationships that pyroxene crystallization started first with precipitation of pigeonite followed by simultaneous precipitation of pigeonite and augite and finally by crystallization of augite alone in the groundmass.},

The 18O/16O values of most of the carbonates studied, however, indicate that the rocks have interacted with hydrothermal fluids, dominantly represented by sea water. In particular, the rocks from the northern section of the Apennines apparently reequilibrated their {$\delta$} 18O content at higher temperature than those from the central zone. Strontium isotope ratios, close to the Cretaceous\textemdash{}Cenozoic ocean water values, are well in agreement with such a kind of sea water/ophicalcites interaction, even if the carbonate cement formed earlier during the Jurassic period.},

All types of coral reef tracts are present: outer or barrier reefs, lagoon reefs and coral banks. The orientation of the spurs was studied as a function of the direction of the swell crests which are either parallel or oblique to the alignment of the reef front of the ``Grand R{\'e}cif'' which extends over 18 km. When the swell is oblique, the spurs are not, as is generally held, perpendicular to the crests of the swell. The orientation of the spurs is a resultant direction between the direction of the swell orthogonals and the direction of the slope of the outer reef flat. From aerial photographs one can determine the directions of the spurs and of the slope of the outer reef flat. It is easy to obtain the direction of the crests of the swell and then to construct the wave diagram. The morphological aspects and the distribution of the deposits on the inner flat of the coral reef tract depend on the orientation of the swell.

Simultaneous in situ digital recording of pressure, temperature, light scattering, and light transmission, in combination with current velocity profiles measured with a near-bottom vertical array of electromagnetic current meters, is used to correlate bottom shear generated by a variety of oceanic processes (waves, tides, mean flow, etc.) with incipient movement and resuspension of bottom sediment. A bottom camera system that is activated when current speeds exceed preset threshold values provides a unique method to identify initial sediment motion and bed form development. Data from a twenty day deployment of the GEOPROBE system in Norton Sound, Alaska, during the period September 24 \textendash{} October 14, 1976 show that threshold conditions for sediment movement are commonly exceeded, even in calm weather periods, due to the additive effects of tidal currents, mean circulation, and surface waves.},

The elements determined both in seawater and shell carbonate are: Ca, Mg, Mn, Fe, Ni, Co, Cu, Zn, Sr and Pb. Both species studied discriminate against all the minor and trace elements determined; the degree of such discrimination, for some elements, is inversely related to salinity. The mineralogical composition of the shells (Monodonta has a mixed mineralogy while Cerastoderma is entirely aragonitic) appears to be controlled neither by temperature nor by salinity. In Monodonta shells direct correlations have been found between the following parameters: calcite-Sr (in younger shells only), calcite-Fe, calcite-Pb (in older shells only), calcite-Zn, salinity-Mg and salinity-Pb, whereas inverse correlations were observed between calcite and Sr (in older shells only) and calcite and Pb (in younger shells only). In Cerastoderma shells a direct correlation was found between salinity and Fe and Mg. The thickness of the shells appears, in both species, to be an inverse linear function of salinity.},

  title = {Geology of the {{Miami Terrace}} and Its Paleo-Oceanographic Implications},
  volume = {30},
  issn = {0025-3227},
  abstract = {The Miami Terrace is a drowned early to middle Tertiary carbonate platform, the outer margin of which has been deeply incised by submarine erosion subsequent to deposition of the limestone terrace. This interpretation is based on the study of high-resolution seismic reflection profiles, rock dredge samples, observations from deep-diving submersibles, and correlation with drill-hole data. The karstic upper terrace (200\textendash{}375 m) yields limestones and dolostones of early middle Miocene age that have shallow-shelf affinities. Truncated beds of an eastward-dipping deeper-water slope facies are exposed on the upper surface of the erosional lower terrace at 600\textendash{}700 m. The upper and lower terraces are separated by a discontinuous ridge, probably a drowned Miocene, or post-Miocene bank margin complex. Both terraces and the ridge are capped by dense conglomeratic phosphorites and phosphatic limestones. Phosphorite nodules are more common on the lower terrace whereas the upper terrace yields large phosphorite slabs as well as shark's teeth and bones of marine mammals. Petrographic study of dredged and submersible-sampled rocks shows that two or more episodes of phosphatization took place intermittent with erosion, grain rounding, reworking and redeposition. Early stages of phosphatization appear to be selective, replacing the more unstable carbonate minerals first, while later stages are nonselective. The origin of most of the phosphorites is the diagenetic replacement of calcium carbonate by francolite. The karst surface of the upper terrace appears to have been produced by subaerial exposure in the middle to late Miocene as evidenced by shallow-water components in the rocks of the upper terrace plus considerations of local subsidence and eustatic sea-level curves. The erosional lower terrace, 200\textendash{}300 m deeper than the upper terrace, would have been too deep to have been produced by subaerial or wave erosion. An erosional hiatus of middle Miocene age in JOIDES drill holes on the Blake Plateau indicates that bottom-current velocities in this area increased over this interval. The formation of the lower erosional terrace is related to increased flow of the Gulf Stream system (Florida Current) and bioerosion concurrent with the tectonic uplift and oceanographic closure of the western Caribbean in mid-Miocene time. The bathymetry, petrology, structure and paleontology of the Miami Terrace, along with correlative data from adjacent areas, argue that a more active Gulf Stream system began as early as the middle Miocene (10.5\textendash{}16 m.y.B.P.) rather than the early to middle Pliocene (3.5\textendash{}4.0 m.y.B.P.) as previously suggested.},

  title = {Preliminary Studies of Offshore Placer Deposits, Eastern {{Australia}}},
  volume = {30},
  issn = {0025-3227},
  abstract = {Offshore exploration during the 1960's for gold off southern New South Wales and for tin in Tasmanian waters did not result in the discovery of economic deposits. Although very rich gold-bearing beach placers were worked in the past, individual deposits were small and rested on bed rock; the chances of locating and exploiting similar deposits offshore appear to be remote. In the case of tin, sub-economic resources were outlined in submerged river channels at a number of places off northeastern Tasmania. Such channels can be outlined by seismic methods, but to locate workable tin deposits in the buried alluvium by drilling alone is likely to be impracticable and successful exploration may depend on the development of other geophysical prospecting techniques. Large resources of rutile- and zircon-bearing heavy-mineral sands have been indicated off the east Australian coast by mining company work, but no economic deposits have been found to date. Studies of the morphology of the eastern shelf by the Bureau of Mineral Resources have revealed linear features believed to be related to shore lines developed during Quaternary low sea-level still stands. The most persistent of these off northern N.S.W. are about 105 m, 85 m, and between 35 and 45 m below present sea level. A widespread change of slope at a depth of 20\textendash{}30 m marks the base of the main body of the present-day paralic-zone wedge of sediment, but seismic profiles indicate that a veneer of recent sediment commonly extends seawards into water depths of about 100 m. Much of the outer shelf is floored by relict sediments and extensive areas of bed rock crop out on the middle shelf. Virtually all sub-surface data from company drilling for heavy-mineral sands relates to the present-day paralic-zone wedge of sediments; this wedge includes undisturbed sedimentary sequences deposited during pre-Holocene high sea-level periods. No large economic-grade deposits have been outlined by this work offshore, and there is reason to believe that the bulk of the heavy-mineral deposits formed during Holocene and previous high sea-level stands are located above present sea level. In addition, the best-developed submerged strand lines are in deep water probably inaccessible to mining. Nevertheless, the possibility that substantial deposits occur offshore in moderate water depths exists. Outcrops of bed rock are extensive in the mid-shelf zone in the southern part of the area, but north of 29\textdegree{} S they are much less common. Significant areas with sediment thicknesses greater than 20 m in water depths of less than 60 m occur to the east of Newcastle, to the southeast of Smoky Cape, and to the north of Yamba. Two sediment sequences, an upper and a lower, are recognizable. Highest heavy-mineral values in surface sediments occur offshore from the Permo-Triassic basins. Subsurface enrichment may occur at the junction of the upper and lower sequences, or where the upper sequence overlies basement. The abundance of heavy minerals is a function of the total sediment throughput, and the intensity and direction of shore-line sorting, so that the highest potential for accumulation occurs in the northern part of the area. The most likely prospective areas occur mainly near Cape Byron and near Sugarloaf Point. These areas have been defined on the basis of the thickness of sediments, the depth to the base of the upper sequence, the distribution of ancient strand lines, and the abundance of heavy minerals in the surface sediments.},

  volume = {30},
  issn = {0025-3227},
  abstract = {In the equatorial Atlantic the Cear{\'a} and Sierra Leone rises lie on opposing sides of the mid-ocean ridge and are equidistant from its axis. The northern and southern boundaries respectively, of the two rises are formed by the same fracture zones. The area of shallowest acoustic basement under the Cear{\'a} Rise coincides with the presence of a 1\textendash{}2 km thick seismic layer (velocity: 3.5 km/sec) lying over the oceanic layer 2. This 3.5 km/sec layer is interpreted as a sequence of volcanics which began erupting about 80 m.y. ago when the sites of the two rises lay at the ridge axis. As the ``abnormal'' volcanic activity ceased, the breakup of this volcanic pile into two pieces has formed the Cear{\'a} and Sierra Leone rises. In the South Atlantic, the northern and southern boundaries of the Rio Grande Rise are also formed by fracture zones and an approximately 1 km thick layer with a velocity of 3.5 km/sec exists also under this rise. The same fracture zones appear to bound the Walvis Ridge. Drilling data suggests that both the Rio Grande Rise and Walvis Ridge have subsided continuously since their creation. The igneous rocks recovered from both rises consist of alkalic basaltic suites typical of oceanic volcanic islands. The existing data favor a model in which ``excessive'' volcanism along the same segment of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge created both the South Atlantic aseismic rises between 100 and 80 m.y. ago. In both the examples, the northern and southern boundaries of the rises are formed by the same fracture zones which originally bounded the abnormally active segment of the ridge axis.},

The pigeonite cores are characterized by high magnesium contents [FeFe + Mg = 0.19 on the average]; their crystallization temperatures based on the three-pyroxene geothermometer are thus estimated to be higher than those of the well-studied tholeiitic pyroxene assemblages (Hakone, Weiselberg, Mull, Skaergaard, and Bushveld). It is suggested from textural and chemical relationships that pyroxene crystallization started first with precipitation of pigeonite followed by simultaneous precipitation of pigeonite and augite and finally by crystallization of augite alone in the groundmass.},

In particular, the rocks from the northern section of the Apennines apparently reequilibrated their {$\delta$} 18O content at higher temperature than those from the central zone. Strontium isotope ratios, close to the Cretaceous\textemdash{}Cenozoic ocean water values, are well in agreement with such a kind of sea water/ophicalcites interaction, even if the carbonate cement formed earlier during the Jurassic period.},

All types of coral reef tracts are present: outer or barrier reefs, lagoon reefs and coral banks. The orientation of the spurs was studied as a function of the direction of the swell crests which are either parallel or oblique to the alignment of the reef front of the ``Grand R{\'e}cif'' which extends over 18 km. When the swell is oblique, the spurs are not, as is generally held, perpendicular to the crests of the swell. The orientation of the spurs is a resultant direction between the direction of the swell orthogonals and the direction of the slope of the outer reef flat. From aerial photographs one can determine the directions of the spurs and of the slope of the outer reef flat. It is easy to obtain the direction of the crests of the swell and then to construct the wave diagram. The morphological aspects and the distribution of the deposits on the inner flat of the coral reef tract depend on the orientation of the swell.

Simultaneous in situ digital recording of pressure, temperature, light scattering, and light transmission, in combination with current velocity profiles measured with a near-bottom vertical array of electromagnetic current meters, is used to correlate bottom shear generated by a variety of oceanic processes (waves, tides, mean flow, etc.) with incipient movement and resuspension of bottom sediment. A bottom camera system that is activated when current speeds exceed preset threshold values provides a unique method to identify initial sediment motion and bed form development. Data from a twenty day deployment of the GEOPROBE system in Norton Sound, Alaska, during the period September 24 \textendash{} October 14, 1976 show that threshold conditions for sediment movement are commonly exceeded, even in calm weather periods, due to the additive effects of tidal currents, mean circulation, and surface waves.},

The elements determined both in seawater and shell carbonate are: Ca, Mg, Mn, Fe, Ni, Co, Cu, Zn, Sr and Pb. Both species studied discriminate against all the minor and trace elements determined; the degree of such discrimination, for some elements, is inversely related to salinity. The mineralogical composition of the shells (Monodonta has a mixed mineralogy while Cerastoderma is entirely aragonitic) appears to be controlled neither by temperature nor by salinity. In Monodonta shells direct correlations have been found between the following parameters: calcite-Sr (in younger shells only), calcite-Fe, calcite-Pb (in older shells only), calcite-Zn, salinity-Mg and salinity-Pb, whereas inverse correlations were observed between calcite and Sr (in older shells only) and calcite and Pb (in younger shells only). In Cerastoderma shells a direct correlation was found between salinity and Fe and Mg. The thickness of the shells appears, in both species, to be an inverse linear function of salinity.},

  title = {Geology of the {{Miami Terrace}} and Its Paleo-Oceanographic Implications},
  volume = {30},
  issn = {0025-3227},
  abstract = {The Miami Terrace is a drowned early to middle Tertiary carbonate platform, the outer margin of which has been deeply incised by submarine erosion subsequent to deposition of the limestone terrace. This interpretation is based on the study of high-resolution seismic reflection profiles, rock dredge samples, observations from deep-diving submersibles, and correlation with drill-hole data. The karstic upper terrace (200\textendash{}375 m) yields limestones and dolostones of early middle Miocene age that have shallow-shelf affinities. Truncated beds of an eastward-dipping deeper-water slope facies are exposed on the upper surface of the erosional lower terrace at 600\textendash{}700 m. The upper and lower terraces are separated by a discontinuous ridge, probably a drowned Miocene, or post-Miocene bank margin complex. Both terraces and the ridge are capped by dense conglomeratic phosphorites and phosphatic limestones. Phosphorite nodules are more common on the lower terrace whereas the upper terrace yields large phosphorite slabs as well as shark's teeth and bones of marine mammals. Petrographic study of dredged and submersible-sampled rocks shows that two or more episodes of phosphatization took place intermittent with erosion, grain rounding, reworking and redeposition. Early stages of phosphatization appear to be selective, replacing the more unstable carbonate minerals first, while later stages are nonselective. The origin of most of the phosphorites is the diagenetic replacement of calcium carbonate by francolite. The karst surface of the upper terrace appears to have been produced by subaerial exposure in the middle to late Miocene as evidenced by shallow-water components in the rocks of the upper terrace plus considerations of local subsidence and eustatic sea-level curves. The erosional lower terrace, 200\textendash{}300 m deeper than the upper terrace, would have been too deep to have been produced by subaerial or wave erosion. An erosional hiatus of middle Miocene age in JOIDES drill holes on the Blake Plateau indicates that bottom-current velocities in this area increased over this interval. The formation of the lower erosional terrace is related to increased flow of the Gulf Stream system (Florida Current) and bioerosion concurrent with the tectonic uplift and oceanographic closure of the western Caribbean in mid-Miocene time. The bathymetry, petrology, structure and paleontology of the Miami Terrace, along with correlative data from adjacent areas, argue that a more active Gulf Stream system began as early as the middle Miocene (10.5\textendash{}16 m.y.B.P.) rather than the early to middle Pliocene (3.5\textendash{}4.0 m.y.B.P.) as previously suggested.},

  title = {Preliminary Studies of Offshore Placer Deposits, Eastern {{Australia}}},
  volume = {30},
  issn = {0025-3227},
  abstract = {Offshore exploration during the 1960's for gold off southern New South Wales and for tin in Tasmanian waters did not result in the discovery of economic deposits. Although very rich gold-bearing beach placers were worked in the past, individual deposits were small and rested on bed rock; the chances of locating and exploiting similar deposits offshore appear to be remote. In the case of tin, sub-economic resources were outlined in submerged river channels at a number of places off northeastern Tasmania. Such channels can be outlined by seismic methods, but to locate workable tin deposits in the buried alluvium by drilling alone is likely to be impracticable and successful exploration may depend on the development of other geophysical prospecting techniques. Large resources of rutile- and zircon-bearing heavy-mineral sands have been indicated off the east Australian coast by mining company work, but no economic deposits have been found to date. Studies of the morphology of the eastern shelf by the Bureau of Mineral Resources have revealed linear features believed to be related to shore lines developed during Quaternary low sea-level still stands. The most persistent of these off northern N.S.W. are about 105 m, 85 m, and between 35 and 45 m below present sea level. A widespread change of slope at a depth of 20\textendash{}30 m marks the base of the main body of the present-day paralic-zone wedge of sediment, but seismic profiles indicate that a veneer of recent sediment commonly extends seawards into water depths of about 100 m. Much of the outer shelf is floored by relict sediments and extensive areas of bed rock crop out on the middle shelf. Virtually all sub-surface data from company drilling for heavy-mineral sands relates to the present-day paralic-zone wedge of sediments; this wedge includes undisturbed sedimentary sequences deposited during pre-Holocene high sea-level periods. No large economic-grade deposits have been outlined by this work offshore, and there is reason to believe that the bulk of the heavy-mineral deposits formed during Holocene and previous high sea-level stands are located above present sea level. In addition, the best-developed submerged strand lines are in deep water probably inaccessible to mining. Nevertheless, the possibility that substantial deposits occur offshore in moderate water depths exists. Outcrops of bed rock are extensive in the mid-shelf zone in the southern part of the area, but north of 29\textdegree{} S they are much less common. Significant areas with sediment thicknesses greater than 20 m in water depths of less than 60 m occur to the east of Newcastle, to the southeast of Smoky Cape, and to the north of Yamba. Two sediment sequences, an upper and a lower, are recognizable. Highest heavy-mineral values in surface sediments occur offshore from the Permo-Triassic basins. Subsurface enrichment may occur at the junction of the upper and lower sequences, or where the upper sequence overlies basement. The abundance of heavy minerals is a function of the total sediment throughput, and the intensity and direction of shore-line sorting, so that the highest potential for accumulation occurs in the northern part of the area. The most likely prospective areas occur mainly near Cape Byron and near Sugarloaf Point. These areas have been defined on the basis of the thickness of sediments, the depth to the base of the upper sequence, the distribution of ancient strand lines, and the abundance of heavy minerals in the surface sediments.},

  abstract = {Seabed drifters were used to investigate bottom-water movements in Western Port, Victoria, Australia and in nearby parts of Bass Strait. The objective was to document circulation in and around the entrance areas and also throughout the bay, placing emphasis on smaller-scale patterns associated with net flood or ebb movements. Approximately 2000 seabed drifters were released in close-spaced arrays, half between November and December, 1974, during the summer wind regime, and the other half in September\textendash{}October, 1975, before the onset of the summer wind regime. The 1974 deployment was made along 26 transects located throughout the major and minor channels of the bay and its entrances, and in Bass Strait. Groups of 5\textendash{}15 drifters were released at any station. The 1975 deployment was based on the 1974 results and release stations were chosen to elucidate specific characteristics previously observed and also to document the characteristics of bottom-water movement associated with spring and neap tides. Drifter returns were 37\% for the 1974 releases and 16\% for 1975. These numbers were adequate to clearly define the patterns of bottom-water movement in and around the bay. In some cases drifters were retrieved by fishing boats so that drift rates could be computed. Results show an eastward movement of bottom waters in Bass Strait with net speeds of 2.3 cm/sec (1.9 km/day). The main net inward movement of water to the bay is through the western side of the Western Entrance with an ebb-dominant zone existing on the eastern side. At the Eastern Entrance, evidence of net movement is inconclusive. Detailed circulation patterns for eight smaller-scale features have been recognised and these are often closely related to the morphology of various segments of the bay. The net movement within the bay is clockwise around French Island.},

The output consists of arrays of tide height and two horizontal velocity components at each grid point and computational time step. The Pollutant Transport Model uses Elder's equations for longitudinal and transverse dispersion in an open channel. The trajectories of computational particles of water carrying pollutants and other materials are calculated at successive times as they are moved by the currents and as they are spread by the action of turbulence and non-uniformities in the velocity profile. This model treats the non-reactive or conservative materials in the water. The Chemical Kinetics and Interaction Model, which is run jointly with the Pollutant Transport Model, simulates the behaviour of non-conservative and interacting materials. Quantities modelled are heat content, organic carbon, dissolved oxygen, nitrogen in its various forms, suspended sediment discharges, coliform bacteria, and any exponentially decaying materials. The model computes concentrations of materials at the various grid points and time steps. The Hydrodynamic and Pollutant Transport Models have been run for an average tide (the M2 component) and a sequence of spring tides. Computed half-tidal fluxes across seven sections dividing the major segments of the bay compared favourably with measured values. A detailed comparison of depth-averaged velocities was also made at the seven sections. These models have been used to predict the patterns of water movement in the bay and to interpret observations made in some of the other studies.},

  abstract = {The study of the hydrochemistry of Western Port began in June 1973 as part of the Westernport Bay Environmental Study. The objectives were to understand nutrient dynamics and to assist in formulation of management guidelines for the bay and for use in mathematical modelling, Parameters measured included: inorganic forms of nitrogen, reactive phosphorus, total phosphorus, chlorophylls, dissolved oxygen, particulate and total organic carbon, salinity and reactive silica. Detailed sampling of Western Port waters was carried out every three weeks throughout the four-year period. Initially a 48-station grid was used, but as the study progressed this was expanded to 62 stations and 26 shore locations. Analyses of detailed salinity and reactive-silica distributions have revealed the major features of water circulation. Water moves around French Island in a clockwise direction and some recycling occurs off Tortoise Head to form a complete loop. A clockwise movement exists in the Western Entrance Segment while a weak counter-clockwise movement exists in the Rhyll Segment. An exchange period of about twelve weeks is indicated for waters in the upper parts of Western Port.},

Interpretations were based on data from field mapping, aerial photographs, sediment sampling, depth profiling at selected sites, and limited SCUBA inspection. The complex shape of the bay is determined by geological factors and only minor stream discharge and associated sediment input occurs. Tidal activity is dominant and estuarine circulation is not well developed. Eight intertidal and subtidal environments have been recognised. Net long-term paths of sand transport and deposition, and zones of ebb dominance and flood dominance were delineated within the bay and suggest a landward reworking by tidal processes. The extensive intertidal environments show variable sediment distribution patterns of sand and mud, controlled by salt marsh, mangroves, and dense intertidal and subtidal seagrass meadows. Sand is concentrated mainly in tidal channels and associated subtidal offshore banks. Mud is dominant in the Embayment Head and in isolated intertidal areas, except where autochthonous sand is abundant. Suspended sediment is active in the channels, particularly near mud-rich intertidal areas.},

  abstract = {Western Port is a tidal embayment, and the characteristics of oscillatory tidal currents, overall net and small-scale circulation patterns, and aspects of the mode, frequency and mass transport of sediment are presented. The results of the studies reported in this volume are both corroborative and complementary, and their integration has resulted in a much better understanding of the bay than could otherwise have been obtained. Consideration of dynamic process, sedimentation patterns and morphology has allowed the distinction of four ``systems'' within the bay: 1.(1) High-energy channel/bank system (Western Entrance to just beyond the Confluence Zone), characterised by strong tidal currents, varying degrees of surface wave activity, and a sandy substrate. Middle Bank represents the largest individual sand body in Western Port and is associated with intense sediment movement. Sand transported from Middle Bank through the Confluence Zone supplies and maintains the sandy deposits and beaches in the Lower North Arm and East Arm. Seismic evidence coupled with estimates of mass transport of sand suggest that during the Holocene, 103 to 104 g cm-1 yr-1 have been transported from Middle Bank to Cowes Bank in order to produce the extensive sedimentary complex in that region.2.(2) Ebb/flood differentiated segments with contrasting intertidal sediments (lower North Arm, Corinella Segment), characterised by clearly differentiated flood- and ebb-dominant zones, sandy and muddy intertidal sediment deposition.3.(3) Subtidal, partly enclosed mud-deposition basin (Rhyll Segment), characterised as a shallow, subtidal, depositional basin collecting fine sediments. A central clay-size zone is flanked by coarser sediments. Circulation is weak and sediment transport is minimal.4.(4) Extensive intertidal flat systems with minor channels (Embayment Head), characterised by a web of minor channels, and luxuriant seagrass meadows except in the regions of the Bunyip and Lang Lang Rivers. Local flood- and ebb-dominant transport paths are defined by sandy deposits of reworked or autochthonous Pleistocene sands.},

Instrumented tripods were used at nine stations to collect data on bottom currents, tidal conditions and wave activity in the major channel system of the bay. Bottom currents generated by tides ranged up to 70 cm/sec. The ratio of tidal range to half-tidal period ({$\Delta$}H{$\Delta$}T) was compared with measured currents to provide a basis for prediction of the annual frequency distribution of maximum bottom-current velocities. Flow directions do not always conform to channel alignments, and deviations are important. Net flows at the stations indicate patterns of ebb and flood dominance, and a clockwise net circulation around a large central island. Wave activity was generally insufficient to generate bottom pressure fluctuations, except in the exposed Western Entrance which opens to Bass Strait.},

  abstract = {Hydrodynamic data were obtained in Western Port to provide information about the tides and flow conditions and to estimate the bed friction coefficient and evaluate other constants necessary for calibrating a mathematical hydrodynamic model. The data collection and analysis program included meteorological data to compute wind shear at the water surface; tidal amplitude and phase from tide gauges placed at eight locations within the bay; current speed and direction profiles across seven traverse lines bounding major segments of the bay; drogue tracking over various ebb cycles in the Western and Eastern Entrances; and dye-dispersion studies during conditions of flood and ebb phases of spring and neap tides. Dye-dispersion studies were actually carried out in 1968 and the data have been used in this study. The lunar semidiurnal tide is the principal driving mechanism for the waters of the bay. Tidal range increases towards the head of the bay to a maximum of about 1.3 times the range at the entrance. Tidal lag at the head of the bay is about 2 hours. In most channels the depth-mean velocity attains a maximum of 0.6 m/sec; however, local topographic effects have a strong influence on both the velocity field and tidal lag. Under pure tidal motion there appears to be a clockwise circulation around Phillip Island and possibly French Island. Winds stronger than 10 m/sec are related to anomalous tides throughout the bay and also appear to exert a significant influence on the net circulation around the islands.},

Some major conclusions were: (1) six coastal areas were identified for conservation; (2) some industrial development, housing, and recreational facilities could be extended with appropriate environmental safeguards; (3) considerable care may be needed in the discharges of phosphorus to protect the bay's potentially susceptible ecosystems; (4) additional port facilities that require dredging and disposal could cause significant environmental damage and proposed projects should be carefully and individually assessed.

The regional study also is linked with studies of the catchments of Port Phillip and the Gippsland Lakes.

  abstract = {During the past few years a series of measurements has been made of flow conditions and associated sediment motion occurring in several high-velocity tidal channels in Puget Sound, Washington. Measurements consist of the velocity distribution occurring within 2 m of the bed, visual observation of the occurrence of incipient grain movement, and time-lapse photography of the seabed. From these data estimates have been made of the mean bottom velocity ({\=U}100), shear velocity (U{${_\ast}$}) and Shield's friction coefficient (\texttheta{}t) associated with the sediment movement. Results indicate that for mean grain sizes ranging from 0.30 mm to 1.10 mm and a variety of bed configurations the critical values of {\=U}100, U{${_\ast}$}, and \texttheta{}t required to initiate general sediment motion agree with experimentally derived competency curves. The bed-load transport of sediment corresponding to the occurrence of general sediment motion for grain sizes approximately 0.40 mm in diameter is estimated to be 8.4{$\cdot$}10-3 g cm-1sec-1. This movement is associated with mean velocity ({\=U}100) and shear velocity (U{${_\ast}$}) of 38.5 and 2.30 cm/sec, respectively.},

  abstract = {An efficient approach for evaluating storm tide return levels along the southeastern coastline of Australia under present and future climate conditions is described. Storm surge height probabilities for the present climate are estimated using hydrodynamic model simulations of surges identified in recent tide gauge records. Tides are then accounted for using a joint probability method. Storm tide height return levels obtained in this way are similar to those obtained from the direct analysis of tide gauge records. The impact of climate change on extreme sea levels is explored by adding a variety of estimates of mean sea level rise and by forcing the model with modified wind data. It is shown that climate change has the potential to reduce average recurrence intervals of present climate 1 in 100~year storm tide levels along much of the northern Bass Strait coast to between 1 and 2~years by the year 2070.},

  volume = {33},
  issn = {0899-8418},
  abstract = {Abstract Current climate 1-in-100-year storm tide heights along the coast of Victoria, southeast Australia were estimated by combining probabilities of storm surge and tide heights determined from hydrodynamic modelling. For this return period, levels lie between 1 and 2 m above mean sea level along much of the coastline. Future climate 1-in-100-year storm tide heights were estimated by adding high-end estimates of future sea-level rise from recent literature. The effect of climate change through consistent wind-speed increases was also examined and it was found that, for the late 21st Century, the contribution of wind-speed increase to the increases in extreme storm surge heights is considerably smaller, by a factor of more than 2, than the contribution of sea-level rise. A computationally inexpensive approach to assessing current and future vulnerability to coastal inundation due to sea-level extremes is then demonstrated for the Victorian coast. A simple inundation algorithm was used with high-resolution terrestrial elevation data from a Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) survey of the Victorian coast to evaluate the potential vulnerability of nine coastal regions to inundation by current and future climate 1-in-100-year storm tides. The response of different regions varied from exhibiting proportional increases in inundation to sea-level rise to nonlinear responses, where the exceedance of critical sea-level thresholds led to large stepwise increases in land area or number of land parcels affected by inundation. These responses were a function of both coastal topography and the spatial density of land parcels. The low computational cost of the methodology permits different time horizons and uncertainties in future climate change to be considered using a scenario-based approach and is therefore useful in assessing options for adaptation to climate change.

  volume = {97},
  issn = {0272-7714},
  abstract = {Tidal saline wetlands (TSW), such as mangrove and salt marsh systems, provide many valuable ecosystem services, but continue to suffer disturbance, degradation and deforestation. Tropical mangroves perform a critical role in the exchange and storage of terrestrial\textendash{}marine carbon but can function as a source of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). However, little is known of biogeochemical processes in temperate mangrove and salt marsh systems in the southern hemisphere. In this study, the soil/sediment exchange of CO2, CH4 and N2O was measured seasonally along a natural transition from melaleuca woodland, salt marsh and into mangroves along the Mornington Peninsula edge of Westernport Bay, Victoria, Australia. Soil/sediment physiochemical properties and sediment C density were measured concurrently. The melaleuca woodland soil was a constant CH4 sink of approximately~-25~{$\mu$}g~C~m-2~h-1 but along the transect this rapidly switched to a weak CH4 source ({$<$}5~{$\mu$}g~C~m-2~h-1) in the salt marsh which increased further in the mangrove sediments where emissions of up to 375~{$\mu$}g~C~m-2~h-1 were measured in summer. Sediment CH4 exchange correlated with salinity, pneumatophore number and the redox potential of sediment water at depth. All three ecosystems were a small N2O source of {$<$}10~{$\mu$}g~N~m-2~h-1. Soil\textendash{}atmosphere exchange was dominated by CO2 which showed a significant response according to ecosystem and season along with soil temperature and salinity. Sediment C density was significantly greater in the salt marsh than the mangrove. Salt marsh sediment C density was 168~Mg~C~ha-1 which is comparable with that measured globally, whereas the mangrove sediment C density of 145~Mg~C~ha-1 is among the lowest reported. Contrary to global patterns in terrestrial soil C content and salt marsh sediment C content, data from our study indicate that mangrove sediments from a cooler, drier temperate latitude may store less C than mangroves in warmer and wetter tropical latitudes. Understanding both C storage and the greenhouse gas balance of TSWs will help us to better value these vulnerable ecosystems and manage them accordingly.},

  volume = {128},
  issn = {0272-7714},
  abstract = {Estimates of carbon store and carbon accumulation rate in mangrove and saltmarsh are beset by issues of scale and provenance. Estimates at a site do not allow scaling to regional estimates if the drivers of variability are not known. Also, carbon accumulation within soils provides a net offset only if carbon is derived in-situ, or would not otherwise be sequestered. We use a network of observation sites extending across 2000~km of southeastern Australian coastline to determine the influence of geomorphic setting and coastal wetland vegetation type on rates of carbon accumulation, carbon store and probable sources. Carbon accumulation above feldspar marker horizons over a 10-year period was driven primarily by tidal range and position in the tidal frame, and was higher for mangrove and saltmarsh dominated by Juncus kraussii than for other saltmarsh communities. The rate of carbon loss with depth varied between geomorphic settings and was the primary determinant of carbon store. A down-core enrichment in {$\delta$}13C was consistent with an increased relative contribution of mangrove root material to soil carbon, as mangrove roots were found to be consistently enriched compared to leaves. We conclude that while surface carbon accumulation is driven primarily by tidal transport of allocthonous sediment, in-situ carbon sequestration is the dominant source of recalcitrant carbon, and that mangrove and saltmarsh carbon accumulation and store is high in temperate settings, particularly in mesotidal and fluvial geomorphic settings.},

Three primary types of Holocene embayment fill are recognized: `open ocean', `barrier estuary' and `drowned river valley'. An evolutionary model is proposed to account for their various stages of development. Rapid accumulation of marine sand in mid-Holocene times resulted in the formation of coastal sand barriers and of estuaries that progressively infilled with fluvial/estuarine deposits. In the Late Holocene, there is strong evidence that erosion has dominated over accretion: sandy bays have deepened and many barriers have retreated. Our model predicts that, with extreme or prolonged wave erosion, barriers may be destroyed and estuarine deposits reworked to produce mixed `fluvial'/`marine' sediments. Similar polygenetic sediments are produced when an estuary completely infills and river sand is supplied to the coast. In such cases coastal erosion may be countered or reversed.},

This classification includes both morphologic and evolutionary components and is based on dominant coastal processes. It has the potential to predict responses in geomorphology, facies and stratigraphy. The significance of this classification is its evolutionary capability, and its inclusion of all major clastic coastal depositional environments, making it more comprehensive than previous classifications. We employ a ternary process classification with two axes. The first (horizontal axis) is defined as the relative power of wave versus tidal processes. The second (vertical) axis represents relative fluvial power (increasing upward). A ternary diagram defined by these axes can be used to illustrate the genetic process-response relationships between major coastal environments. The evolutionary classification combines the concept of two sediment sources (river and marine) with a relative sea-level parameter to classify embayed as well as linear and elongate/lobate shorelines. This approach identifies the evolutionary relationships between coastal sedimentary environments. The new ternary approach to process classification can be applied to estuaries and lagoons to define wave and tide end-member facies models, each consisting of a tripartite facies zonation. The evolutionary classification is compatible with sequence stratigraphy because sediment supply and relative sea level are included, and serves as a starting point for more refined coastal stratigraphic analyses.},

It is shown that the two methods give almost identical sediment accumulation rates. There are seasonal variations with low rates in summer ({$\approx$} 260 g/m2*y) and high rates ({$\approx$} 2600 g/m2*y) in fall and winter. Sediment accumulation rates are positively correlated with strong winds from the south-west.

  volume = {128},
  issn = {0272-7714},
  abstract = {Estimates of carbon store and carbon accumulation rate in mangrove and saltmarsh are beset by issues of scale and provenance. Estimates at a site do not allow scaling to regional estimates if the drivers of variability are not known. Also, carbon accumulation within soils provides a net offset only if carbon is derived in-situ, or would not otherwise be sequestered. We use a network of observation sites extending across 2000~km of southeastern Australian coastline to determine the influence of geomorphic setting and coastal wetland vegetation type on rates of carbon accumulation, carbon store and probable sources. Carbon accumulation above feldspar marker horizons over a 10-year period was driven primarily by tidal range and position in the tidal frame, and was higher for mangrove and saltmarsh dominated by Juncus kraussii than for other saltmarsh communities. The rate of carbon loss with depth varied between geomorphic settings and was the primary determinant of carbon store. A down-core enrichment in {$\delta$}13C was consistent with an increased relative contribution of mangrove root material to soil carbon, as mangrove roots were found to be consistently enriched compared to leaves. We conclude that while surface carbon accumulation is driven primarily by tidal transport of allocthonous sediment, in-situ carbon sequestration is the dominant source of recalcitrant carbon, and that mangrove and saltmarsh carbon accumulation and store is high in temperate settings, particularly in mesotidal and fluvial geomorphic settings.},

  volume = {29},
  issn = {0277-3791},
  abstract = {The abrupt transition from fluvial to marine deposition of incised-valley-fill sediments retrieved from the southeast Vietnamese shelf, accurately records the postglacial transgression after 14ka before present (BP). Valley-filling sediments consist of fluvial mud, whereas sedimentation after the transgression is characterized by shallow-marine carbonate sands. This change in sediment composition is accurately marked in high-resolution X-ray fluorescence (XRF) core scanning records. Rapid aggradation of fluvial sediments at the river mouth nearly completely filled the Mekong incised valley prior to flooding. However, accumulation rates strongly reduced in the valley after the river-mouth system flooded and stepped back. This also affected the sediment supply to deeper parts of the southeast Vietnamese shelf. Comparison of the Mekong valley-filling with the East Asian sea-level history of sub- and inter-tidal sediment records shows that the transgressive surface preserved in the incised-valley-fill records is a robust sea-level indicator. The valley was nearly completely filled with fluvial sediments between 13.0 and 9.5~kaBP when sea-level rose rather constantly with approximately 10~mm/yr, as indicated by the~East Asian sea-level record. At shallower parts of the shelf, significant sediment reworking and the establishment of estuarine conditions at the final stage of infilling complicates accurate dating of the transgressive surface. Nevertheless, incised-valley-fill records and land-based drill sites indicate a vast and rapid flooding of the shelf from the location of the modern Vietnamese coastline to the Cambodian lowlands between 9.5~ka and 8.5~kaBP. Fast flooding of this part of the shelf is related with the low shelf gradient and a strong acceleration of the East Asian sea-level rise from 34 to 9 meter below modern sea level (mbsl) corresponding to the sea-level jump of melt water pulse (MWP) 1C.},

Numerous headlands locally restrict shore-parallel transport except in the Ninety-Mile Beach region of eastern Victoria. Mean grain size of foreshore beach sediments ranges from very coarse sand to fine sand. Sorting is typically very good. Both slightly positive and slightly negative skewed sediments occur. Few textural patterns are apparent however, coarsest samples are from Cape Otway and Cape Schank with a decrease in grain size away from the Cape Otway headland. The common general relationship between mean grain size and sorting is not displayed because the coarsest beaches are among the most well-sorted. The composition of Victorian beach sediments ranges greatly with quartz and biogenic skeletal fragments being most common. Feldspar is locally abundant. Most beach sediment is derived from proximal sources but there is indication of transport along significant portions of each coastal section.]},

  title = {A Morphodynamic Model to Simulate the Seasonal Closure of Tidal Inlets},
  volume = {37},
  issn = {0378-3839},
  abstract = {Seasonally open tidal inlets usually occur in microtidal, wave-dominated coastal environments where strong seasonal variations of streamflow and wave climate are experienced. These inlets are closed to the ocean for a number of months every year due to the formation of sand bars across their entrances. The annual closure of these inlets inhibits ocean access for boats and could also cause deterioration of water quality in the estuary/lagoon connected to the inlet. As these estuaries/lagoons are commonly used as harbours or recreational facilities there is increased interest in keeping the inlets permanently open. A process-based numerical model capable of simulating inlet closure is invaluable in terms of identifying the natural processes governing inlet closure. As a further step, this type of model could also be used to determine the effect of any proposed engineering solutions to keep the inlet open on the adjacent beaches. A morphodynamic model capable of simulating the seasonal closure of inlets, which includes both longshore (LST) and cross-shore transport (CST) processes, was developed in this study. Application of the model to two idealised scenarios indicated that cross-shore processes govern inlet behaviour when LST rates were low. The Dean's criterion [Dean, R.G., 1973. Heuristic models of sand transport in the surf zone. Proc. Conf. on Eng. Dynamics in the Surf Zone, Sydney, pp. 208\textendash{}214.] for on\textendash{}offshore transport was employed to show that, for small offshore wave incidence angles, onshore transport aided inlet closure when the offshore wave steepness (Ho/Lo) was less than the critical wave steepness (Ho/Lo)crit, while offshore transport helped to keep the inlet open when (Ho/Lo) was greater than (Ho/Lo)crit. LST was found to be the dominant process leading to inlet closure when (Ho/Lo) was much larger than (Ho/Lo)crit or when the offshore wave incidence angle was large.},

  abstract = {In this study, we combined grain size and geochemical analyses with radioisotope analysis of lead-210 (210Pb), caesium-137 (137Cs) and radiocarbon (14C) ages to reconstruct the sedimentation history of two urbanised coastal lagoons in south-east Australia. Towradgi and Fairy Lagoons were both found to exhibit slow initial sedimentation of less than 1~mm~year-1 prior to anthropogenic influences. Land clearing in the catchments increased runoff and erosion in the creeks feeding into the estuaries, and has resulted in progradation of fluvial material into the estuarine systems with a marked increase in sedimentation to between 2 and 7~mm~year-1. The upper 20\textendash{}50~cm of the sediment column in both lagoons contained elevated concentrations of heavy metals such as Pb, Cu, Ni and Zn. This pollution trend was found to be consistent with the history of industrialisation and urbanisation in the region, which expanded rapidly post World War 2. The total metal concentrations were consistent with other urbanised/industrialised estuaries around the world. Despite the fairly disturbed nature of these coastal lagoons, the use of 210Pb, 137Cs and 14C dating in combination with bulk geochemical analyses allowed detailed reconstruction of sedimentation history.},

  issn = {1038-4871},
  abstract = {Abstract A 4.3?m-long peat sequence from the shore of Lake Tiriara, Mangaia, Cook Islands, was analyzed using an ITRAX core scanner equipped with a magnetic susceptibility meter. Variations in the elemental profiles, providing insights into long- and short-term environmental changes over the last 3500?years, are supported by grain size data and diatom assemblages. The scattering ratio (Mo Inc/Mo Coh) was evaluated and found to represent a good proxy for organic matter in peat. X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) data were processed by principal component analysis that confirmed the distinction of biogenic and detrital phases, organic matter and elements of marine origin. The record preserved in the peat sequence includes a peatland infilling stage followed by alternating drier and wetter periods. A notable steady increase in clay associated with high counts of detrital elements from 2000?1700?cal?yr BP is attributed to increased erosion, which is most probably linked with human colonization and/or more intense chemical weathering linked with a wetter climate. Freshwater gastropods (Melanoides sp.), which were possibly introduced by humans, or are native, occupied the wetland during a period of lower water level about 1000?1100?cal?yr BP. Short-term changes in the elemental profiles are often linked with slight coarsening of the inorganic fraction that is, however, only revealed after grain size analysis. Peaks in marine indicators (Br, Cl, S, and/or Ca) associated with marine-dominated diatom assemblages most probably represent marine incursions through the underground tunnel in the makatea, a fossilized, uplifted coral limestone rim. While none of the marine event units present characteristics typical of cyclone or tsunami deposits, the concurrent or absent peak of detrital elements (Fe, Si, Rb, Ti, K) attributed to increased erosion of the volcanic cone associated with a cyclone is used to distinguish both types of events, as also suggested by principal component analysis.},

  volume = {11},
  issn = {0951-8312},
  abstract = {This paper describes an estuarine classification scheme developed for a wide variety of New Zealand estuaries that has application to coastal resource management. Estuaries are grouped using existing geological and topographic map and air photograph data bases complimented by field reconnaissance. Estuaries are grouped into five classes, and these reflect the primary process that shaped the basin that forms the estuary namely: (1) fluvial erosion, (2) marine/fluvial erosion, (3) tectonic, (4) volcanic, and (5) glacial. These classes are subdivided on a morphologic basis into 16 types, which reflect catchment and coastal hydrologic and sedimentologic processes. Fluvial origin estuaries include unrestricted inlets, headland enclosed inlets, barrier-enclosed lagoons (double-spit, single-spit, tombolo, island and beach barriers) and river mouth (straight-banked, spit-lagoon and deltaic) types. Estuaries of marine/fluvial erosion origin are coastal embayments. Estuaries of tectonic origin include fault defined embayments (inlet width {$<$}2 km) and large diastrophic embayments of more complex origin (inlet widths {$>$}5 km). Explosion craters are of volcanic origin, while glacial estuaries are of a glacial origin. Compound estuaries are formed from two or more of the basic types. Relationships between inlet throat dimensions and tidal prism support the scheme structure.},

Three primary types of Holocene embayment fill are recognized: `open ocean', `barrier estuary' and `drowned river valley'. An evolutionary model is proposed to account for their various stages of development. Rapid accumulation of marine sand in mid-Holocene times resulted in the formation of coastal sand barriers and of estuaries that progressively infilled with fluvial/estuarine deposits. In the Late Holocene, there is strong evidence that erosion has dominated over accretion: sandy bays have deepened and many barriers have retreated. Our model predicts that, with extreme or prolonged wave erosion, barriers may be destroyed and estuarine deposits reworked to produce mixed `fluvial'/`marine' sediments. Similar polygenetic sediments are produced when an estuary completely infills and river sand is supplied to the coast. In such cases coastal erosion may be countered or reversed.},

  abstract = {Sediment chronologies based on radioisotope depth profiles were developed at two sites in the San Francisco Bay estuary to provide a framework for interpreting historical trends in organic compound and metal contaminant inputs. At Richardson Bay near the estuary mouth, sediments are highly mixed by biological and/or physical processes. Excess 234Th penetration ranged from 2 to more than 10 cm at eight coring sites, yielding surface sediment mixing coefficients ranging from 12 to 170 cm2/year. At the site chosen for contaminant analyses, excess 210Pb activity was essentially constant over the upper 25 cm of the core with an exponential decrease below to the supported activity between 70 and 90 cm. Both 137Cs and 239,240Pu penetrated to 57-cm depth and have broad subsurface maxima between 33 and 41 cm. The best fit of the excess 210Pb profile to a steady state sediment accumulation and mixing model yielded an accumulation rate of 0.825 g/cm2/year (0.89 cm/year at sediment surface), surface mixing coefficient of 71 cm2/year, and 33-cm mixed zone with a half-Gaussian depth dependence parameter of 9 cm. Simulations of 137Cs and 239,240Pu profiles using these parameters successfully predicted the maximum depth of penetration and the depth of maximum 137Cs and 239,240Pu activity. Profiles of successive 1-year hypothetical contaminant pulses were generated using this parameter set to determine the age distribution of sediments at any depth horizon. Because of mixing, sediment particles with a wide range of deposition dates occur at each depth. A sediment chronology was derived from this age distribution to assign the minimum age of deposition and a date of maximum deposition to a depth horizon. The minimum age of sediments in a given horizon is used to estimate the date of first appearance of a contaminant from its maximum depth of penetration. The date of maximum deposition is used to estimate the peak year of input for a contaminant from the depth interval with the highest concentration of that contaminant. Because of the extensive mixing, sediment-bound constituents are rapidly diluted with older material after deposition. In addition, contaminants persist in the mixed zone for many years after deposition. More than 75 years are required to bury 90\% of a deposited contaminant below the mixed zone. Reconstructing contaminant inputs is limited to changes occurring on a 20-year time scale. In contrast, mixing is much lower relative to accumulation at a site in San Pablo Bay. Instead, periods of rapid deposition and/or erosion occurred as indicated by frequent sand-silt laminae in the X-radiograph. 137Cs, 239,240Pu, and excess 210Pb activity all penetrated to about 120 cm. The distinct maxima in the fallout radionuclides at 105\textendash{}110 cm yielded overall linear sedimentation rates of 3.9 to 4.1 cm/year, which are comparable to a rate of 4.5{$\pm$}1.5 cm/year derived from the excess 210Pb profile.},

  abstract = {Probabilistic methods provide a means of demonstrating the potential variability in predictions of coastal cliff recession. They form the basis for risk-based land use planning, cliff management and engineering decision-making. A range of probabilistic methods for predicting soft coastal cliff recession has now been developed, including statistical techniques, process-based simulation and structured use of expert judgement. A new episodic stochastic simulation model is introduced, which models the duration between cliff falls as a gamma process and fall size as a log-normal distribution. The method is applied to cliff recession data from a coastal site in the UK using maximum likelihood and Bayesian parameter estimation techniques. The Bayesian parameter estimation method enables expert geomorphological assessment of the local landslide characteristics and measurements of individual cliff falls to be combined with sparse historic records of cliff recession. An episodic simulation model is often preferable to conventional regression models, which are based on assumptions that are seldom consistent with the physical process of cliff recession.},

  title = {High Resolution Modeling and Data Assimilation in the {{Monterey Bay}} Area},
  volume = {22},
  issn = {0278-4343},
  abstract = {A high resolution, data assimilating ocean model of the Monterey Bay area (ICON model) is under development within the framework of the project ``An Innovative Coastal-Ocean Observing Network'' (ICON) sponsored by the National Oceanographic Partnership Program. The main objective of the ICON model development is demonstration of the capability of a high resolution model to track the major mesoscale ocean features in the Monterey Bay area when constrained by the measurements and nested within a regional larger-scale model. This paper focuses on the development of the major ICON model components, including grid generation and open boundary conditions, coupling with a larger scale, Pacific West Coast (PWC) model, atmospheric forcing etc. Impact of these components on the Model's predictive skills in reproducing major hydrographic conditions in the Monterey Bay area are analyzed. Comparisons between observations and the ICON model predictions with and without coupling to the PWC model, show that coupling with the regional model improves significantly both the correlation between the ICON model and observed ADCP currents, and the ICON model's skill in predicting the location and intensity of observed upwelling events. Analysis of the ICON model mixed layer depth predictions show that the ICON model tends to develop a thicker than observed mixed layer during the summer time, and while assimilation of sea surface temperature data is enough for development of observed thin mixed layer in the regional larger-scale model, the fine-resolution ICON model needs variable heat fluxes as surface boundary conditions for the accurate prediction of the vertical thermal structure. The paper targets researchers involved in high-resolution numerical modeling of coastal areas in which the dynamics are determined by the complex geometry of a coastline, variable bathymetry and by the influence of complex water masses from a complicated hydrographic system (such as the California Current system).},

  issn = {0025-3227},
  abstract = {The Santa Cruz coastal terrace fringes much of the northern Monterey Bay region, California. It consists mainly of a regressive sequence of high-energy, barred nearshore marine sediments deposited during the last (Sangamonian) highstand of sea level. This sequence can be sub-divided into several depth-dependent facies on the basis of paleo-current data and vertical sequence of sedimentary structures. These include a lower shoreface facies deposited in 10\textendash{}16 m water depth, an upper shoreface facies (including both a storm-dominated assemblage and a surf zone assemblage) deposited in 0\textendash{}10 m water depth, and a foreshore facies deposited in the swash zone, up to 3.5 m above high tide. The magnitudes of the storm events responsible for depositing these sediments were estimated by calculating paleo-wave heights using a variety of criteria (e.g., critical threshold equations, breaker depths, berm heights). In addition, the climate and paleogeography during the deposition of these sediments were essentially the same as today, allowing the use of present-day wave statistics to estimate the frequency of these storm events. The largest storms formed offshore-flowing currents (e.g., rip, wind-forced, and possibly storm-surge ebb currents) that resulted in the deposition of approximately 30\% of the sediments seaward of the surf zone; however, the magnitude and frequency of these events are unknown. The remaining 70\% of the sediment beyond the surf zone was deposited in response to smaller storm waves which were, on the average, at least 1.6 m high; such waves presently occur no more than 15\% of the time. Sediments deposited during ``fairweather'' conditions (i.e., the remaining 85\% of the time) have a low preservation potential, and are generally not preserved in this facies. In contrast, surf zone sediments were deposited by a variety of processes associated with waves whose maximum offshore heights were probably {$\leq$} 2.2 m; such waves presently occur up to 92\% of the time. Sediments within the swash zone were deposited by waves up to 3 m high, the largest of which presently occur approximately 2\% of the time. Most of the sediments were deposited by storms of intermediate magnitude and frequency; different facies, however, appear to preferentially record events of different recurrence intervals. In particular, surf zone sediments were deposited under relatively small storm and post-storm conditions, whereas sediments deposited farther offshore record increasingly larger, less frequent storm events. Relatively rare events (e.g., the 100 or 1000 yr events) do not appear to have significantly affected sedimentation in these nearshore environments.},

  title = {Estimating Palaeobathymetry of Wave-Graded Continental Shelves from Sediment Texture},
  volume = {52},
  issn = {1365-3091},
  abstract = {The concept of the wave-graded continental shelf, with sea floor sediment coarsening from offshore mud to shoreface sand, has been well known from the time of Johnson (1919). Although most of the modern shelf shows textures unrelated to water depth on account of relict features or sediment starvation, the geological record is more likely to preserve sites where sediment is being fed to a subsiding inner-shelf. These consistently show the landward-coarsening pattern of the wave-graded shelf, recording past water depth history in accumulated sea floor sediment. The landward-coarsening pattern is driven primarily by wave-induced bed shear stress, which increases shoreward exponentially, although it also varies from place to place with wave climate, and can be influenced by sediment concentration and currents. In this study, the relationship between bed shear stress, sediment texture and water depth has been investigated by comparing per cent mud and wave climate data from shore-normal transects of three modern wave-graded coastal settings: Wellington Harbour (low energy) and the Manawatu coast (moderate energy) in New Zealand, and Monterey Bay in California (moderate\textendash{}high energy). Samples from all three locations show a progressive change from poorly sorted mud offshore to well-sorted fine sand nearshore, with the sand\textendash{}mud transition ranging from 3 m (low energy) to 50 m (moderate\textendash{}high energy), reflecting differences in average bed shear. Repeat measurements of per cent mud on seasonal, annual and decadal time scales along a Manawatu coastal transect showed no measurable change, demonstrating equilibrium between sediment supply, wave energy, water depth and sediment texture. A simple model based on the relationship between wave climate, shear stress and per cent mud, and using data and conditions from the modern Manawatu coast, is applied to two mid-Pliocene cyclothems exposed 50 km inland, giving results comparable with estimates from foraminifera and the deep-sea isotope record. Per cent mud offers more detail for palaeobathymetric trends in shallow water shelf strata than other proxy depth recorders, although it is limited to depths above wave base and requires an independent estimate of wave climate if depths are to be quantified.},

Rock exposures occur on the inner shelf, near tectonically uplifting highlands, and on the outer shelf, beyond the reach of the mud depositing on the mid-shelf since the Holocene sea-level rise. The sediment-starved shelf off the Monterey Peninsula and south to Point Sur has a very thin cover of Holocene sediment, and bedrock outcrops occur across the whole shelf, with Salinian granite outcrops surrounding the Monterey Peninsula. Coarse-sand deposits occur both bounded within low-relief rippled scour depressions, and in broad sheets in areas like the Sur Platform where fine sediment sources are limited.

  abstract = {Field measurements of beach morphology and sedimentology were made along the Monterey Peninsula and Carmel Bay, California, in the spring and summer of 1997. These data were combined with low-altitude aerial imagery, high-resolution bathymetry, and local geology to understand how coastal geomorphology, lithology, and tectonics influence the distribution and transport of littoral sediment in the nearshore and inner shelf along a rocky shoreline over the course of decades. Three primary modes of sediment distribution in the nearshore and on the inner shelf off the Monterey Peninsula and in Carmel Bay were observed. Along stretches of the study area that were exposed to the dominant wave direction, sediment has accumulated in shore-normal bathymetric lows interpreted to be paleo-stream channels. Where the coastline is oriented parallel to the dominant wave direction and streams channels trend perpendicular to the coast, sediment-filled paleo-stream channels occur in the nearshore as well, but here they are connected to one another by shore-parallel ribbons of sediment at depths between 2 and 6m. Where the coastline is oriented parallel to the dominant wave direction and onshore stream channels are not present, only shore-parallel patches of sediment at depths greater than 15m are present. We interpret the distribution and interaction or transport of littoral sediment between pocket beaches along this coastline to be primarily controlled by the northwest-trending structure of the region and the dominant oceanographic regime. Because of the structural barriers to littoral transport, peaks in wave energy appear to be the dominant factor controlling the timing and magnitude of sediment transport between pocket beaches, more so than along long linear coasts. Accordingly, the magnitude and timing of sediment transport is dictated by the episodic nature of storm activity.},

  abstract = {The Santa Cruz coastal terrace fringes much of the northern Monterey Bay region, California. It consists mainly of a regressive sequence of high-energy, barred nearshore marine sediments deposited during the last (Sangamonian) highstand of sea level. This sequence can be sub-divided into several depth-dependent facies on the basis of paleo-current data and vertical sequence of sedimentary structures. These include a lower shoreface facies deposited in 10\textendash{}16 m water depth, an upper shoreface facies (including both a storm-dominated assemblage and a surf zone assemblage) deposited in 0\textendash{}10 m water depth, and a foreshore facies deposited in the swash zone, up to 3.5 m above high tide. The magnitudes of the storm events responsible for depositing these sediments were estimated by calculating paleo-wave heights using a variety of criteria (e.g., critical threshold equations, breaker depths, berm heights). In addition, the climate and paleogeography during the deposition of these sediments were essentially the same as today, allowing the use of present-day wave statistics to estimate the frequency of these storm events. The largest storms formed offshore-flowing currents (e.g., rip, wind-forced, and possibly stormsurge ebb currents) that resulted in the deposition of approximately 30\% of the sediments seaward of the surf zone; however, the magnitude and frequency of these events are unknown. The remaining 70\% of the sediment beyond the surf zone was deposited in response to smaller storm waves which were, on the average, at least 1.6 m high; such waves presently occur no more than 15\% of the time. Sediments deposited during ``fairweather'' conditions (i.e., the remaining 85\% of the time) have a low preservation potential, and are generally not preserved in this facies. In contrast, surf zone sediments were deposited by a variety of processes associated with waves whose maximum offshore heights were probably {$<$}2.2 m; such waves presently occur up to 92\% of the time. Sediments within the swash zone were deposited by waves up to 3 m high, the largest of which presently occur approximately 2\% of the time. Most of the sediments were deposited by storms of intermediate magnitude and frequency; different facies, however, appear to preferentially record events of different recurrence intervals. In particular, surf zone sediments were deposited under relatively small storm and post-storm conditions, whereas sediments deposited farther offshore record increasingly larger, less frequent storm events. Relatively rare events (e.g., the 100 or 1000 yr events) do not appear to have significantly affected sedimentation in these nearshore environments.},

  abstract = {A numerical study is presented of the summer buoyancy dynamics of Tomales Bay (California, U.S.A.) which is an example of a shallow mediterranean estuary. Tomales Bay lies along the line of the San Andreas fault, and the resultant unidirectionality of the estuary greatly simplifies its hydrodynamics. The numerical model hindcasts the temperature and salinity of Tomales Bay from 1987 to 1993 using detailed hydrological and meteorological data, and the results are compared with field observations made during that 7-year period. A second simulation is made over the same 7-year period but using the bathymetry for 1861 when the estuary was longer and deeper. This allows an analysis to be made of the effects on the summer buoyancy dynamics of anthropogenic bathymetry changes. The model predicts that the historical estuary experienced greater negative buoyancy inputs during the late summer periods, and became more inverse with faster dispersion near the head of the basin.},
